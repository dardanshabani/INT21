    <p>Chapter 1 lays <a href="#IP">IP</a> the groundwork for the rest of the book. A few fundamentals are
        introduced, including the history and nature of the Internet, the World Wide
        Web, browsers, servers, URLs, MIME types, and HTTP. Also included in Chapter
        1 are brief overviews of the most important topics of the rest of the book.
        Chapter 2 provides an introduction to HTML, including images, links, lists,
        tables, forms, the audio and video elements, the organizational elements, and the
        time element. Small examples are used to illustrate many of the HTML elements
        that are discussed in this chapter.
        The topic of Chapter 3 is cascading style sheets, which provide the standard
        way of imposing style on the content specified in HTML tags. Because of the
        size and complexity of the topic, the chapter does not cover all of the aspects of
        style sheets. The topics discussed are levels of style sheets, style specification formats,
        selector formats, property values, and color. Among the properties covered
        are those for fonts, lists, and margins. Small examples are used to illustrate the
        subjects that are discussed.
        Chapter 4 introduces the core of JavaScript, a powerful language that could
        be used for a variety of different applications. Our interest, of course, is its use
        in Web programming. Although JavaScript has become a large and complex
        language, we use the student’s knowledge of programming in other languages to
        leverage the discussion, thereby providing a useful introduction to the language
        in a manageably small number of pages. Topics covered are the object model of
        JavaScript, its control statements, objects, arrays, functions, constructors, and
        pattern matching.
        Chapter 5 discusses some of the features of JavaScript that are related to
        HTML documents. Included is the use of the basic and DOM 2 event and eventhandling
        model, which can be used in conjunction with some of the elements of
        HTML documents. The HTML canvas element also is described.
        One of the interesting applications of JavaScript is building dynamic HTML
        documents with the Document Object Model (DOM). Chapter 6 provides
        descriptions of a collection of some of the changes that can be made to documents
        with the use of JavaScript and the DOM. Included are positioning elements;
        moving elements; changing the visibility of elements; changing the color, style, and
        size of text; changing the content of tags; changing the stacking order of overlapped
        elements; moving elements slowly; and dragging and dropping elements.
        Chapter 7 presents an introduction to XML, which provides the means to
        design topic-specific markup languages that can be shared among users with
        common interests. Included are the syntax and document structure used by XML,
        namespaces, XML schemas, and the display of XML documents with both cascading
        style sheets and XML transformations. Also included is an introduction to
        Web services and XML processors.
        Chapter 8 introduces the Flash authoring environment, which is used to
        create a wide variety of visual and audio presentations—in particular, those that
        include animation. A series of examples is used to illustrate the development
        processes, including drawing figures, creating text, using color, creating motion
        The lives of most inhabitants of the industrialized countries, as well as many in
        the unindustrialized countries, have been changed forever by the advent of the
        World Wide Web. Although this transformation has had some downsides—for
        example, easier access to pornography and gambling and the ease with which
        people with destructive ideas can propagate those ideas to others—on balance,
        the changes have been enormously positive. Many use the Internet and the World
        Wide Web daily, communicating with friends, relatives, and business associates
        through electronic mail and social networking sites, shopping for virtually anything
        that can be purchased anywhere, and digging up a limitless variety and
        amount of information, from movie theater show times, to hotel room prices
        in cities halfway around the world, to the history and characteristics of the culture
        of some small and obscure society. In recent years, social networking has
        been used effectively to organize social and political demonstrations, and even
        revolutions. Constructing the software and data that provide access to all this
        information requires knowledge of several different technologies, such as markup</p>
        <p id="IP">
            For people, Internet nodes are identified by names; for computers, they are
identified by numeric addresses. This relationship exactly parallels the one
between a variable name in a program, which is for people, and the variable’s
numeric memory address, which is for the machine.
The Internet Protocol (IP) address of a machine connected to the Internet
is a unique 32-bit number. IP addresses usually are written (and thought of) as
four 8-bit numbers, separated by periods. The four parts are separately used by
Internet-routing computers to decide where a message must go next to get to its
destination.
Organizations are assigned blocks of IPs, which they in turn assign to their
machines that need Internet access—which now include virtually all computers.
For example, a small organization may be assigned 256 IP addresses, such
as 191.57.126.0 to 191.57.126.255. Very large organizations, such as
the Department of Defense, may be assigned 16 million IP addresses, which
include IP addresses with one particular first 8-bit number, such as 12.0.0.0
to 12.255.255.255.
Although people nearly always type domain names into their browsers, the
IP works just as well. For example, the IP for United Airlines (www.ual.com)
is 209.87.113.93. So, if a browser is pointed at http://209.87.113.93, it
will be connected to the United Airlines Web site.
In late 1998, a new IP standard, IPv6, was approved, although it still is not
widely used. The most significant change was to expand the address size from 32
bits to 128 bits. This is a change that will soon be essential because the number
of remaining unused IP addresses is diminishing rapidly.
