    <p>A cardholder sends the Authorization data request to the Integrated Issuing
        system.
        Now, the system receives and processes the request, and performs the necessary
        validations. Once the validations are successful, the cardholder will receive
        authorization data. If a validation fails, it sends the corresponding error in the
        response message.
        NOTE: This API would be consumed by users who are presently using version 1 of this API.
        For users who are consuming version 2 of this API, refer to Section ‘Auth. Data Fetch API
        (V2)’.
        Pre-conditions
        • API consumer must share Correlation-ID in the HTTP header for API requests.
        • Correlation-ID must be unique for each request. The maximum supported length
        is 100 alphanumeric characters.
        • API consumer can share Source in the HTTP header for API requests. For the list
        of Source values, see the Pre-conditions for HTTP Header of REST API topic in
